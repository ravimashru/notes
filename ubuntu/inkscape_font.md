# Installing a new font in Inkscape

 1. Create a folder for the font in `/usr/share/fonts/truetype`. (Of course, this is only for TTFs)
 2. Move the `.ttf` file into the newly created folder.
 3. Delete the font caches at `/usr/share/fonts/*fonts-cache-1` and `~/*fonts.cache-1`.
 4. Restart Inkscape.
 5. Enjoy the new font!
